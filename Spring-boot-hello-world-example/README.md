This project contains code how to setup Spring boot with Spring version 4.2.3 and how to get json of an entity.  I have experimented this project on Windows platform with Java8.

How to run:
        mvn spring-boot:run
                      or
        Use IDE by running Application.java
                      or
        Make this application as webapp and deploy in Tomcat/Jetty or any web server.
